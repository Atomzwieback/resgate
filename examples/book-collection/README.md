# Book Collection Example

This is an example, written in javascript (node.js), of a RES service with collections and resource references to books, which can be created, edited and deleted.
* It exposes a collection, `library.books`, containing book model references.
* It exposes book models, `library.book.<BOOK_ID>`, of each book.
* It allows setting the books' *title* and *author* property through the `set` method.
* It allows creating new books that are added to the collection with the `new` method.
* It allows deleting existing books from the collection with the `delete` method.
* It verifies that a *title* and *author* is always set.
* It resets the collection and models on server restart.

## Prerequisite

* Have [NATS Server](https://nats-io.github.io/docs/nats_server/installation.html) and [Resgate](https://resgate.io/docs/get-started/installation/) running
* Have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

## Running the example

Run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Open the client
```
http://localhost:8083
```

## Things to try out

**Realtime updates**  
Run the client in two separate tabs to observe realtime updates.

**System reset**  
Run the client and make some changes. Restart the node.js server to observe resetting of resources in clients.

**Resynchronization**  
Run the client on two separate devices. Disconnect one device, then make changes with the other. Reconnect the first device to observe resynchronization.
